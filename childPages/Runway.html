      <p style="font-size: 2vw;"><h2>Runway</h2></p>

      <p style="font-size: 2vw"> Runways provide the platform for designers to show off their work and make a statement about their collection in an artistic and personal way. Stony-faced Models demonstrate anything from haute couture to streetwear or camp looks on the Catwalk. The runway has come a long way from its beginning in 1860's Paris.

<p style="color:white ; font-size:2vw;font-family:georgia">
What you typically see on runways does not meet commerce, as they are meant for the purpose of art rather than mundane wear. As time has progressed runway shows have become extravagant displays of work with boundary-pushing set designs. Some really interesting styles have made it to the runway. The presentation is meant to be "performance and fashion art." You're supposed to deconstruct the individual presentations and consider the various pieces for their individual merit. Some are conceptual "fashion," but a lot are actual designs that people will buy at expensive stores.

<p style="color:white;font-family:georgia;font-size: 2vw"> Fashion shows of the 80s and 90s and specifically notable in the way the clothes were presented. Rather than the stoic and expressionless faces, Runway shows from 20 to 40 years ago had models twirling, spinning, smiling and at times, even dancing. There was a lot more face time for models. Many of them posted against the back wall, turned back, and walked to the tip of a “T” runway that was actually elevated, instead of the grounded straight single-file runway we see today.
Because models stood on the stage for the duration of the show, the audience had more time to examine the outfits and absorb the collection as a whole. This era is generally where we see the term "supermodel" come into play.

<aside class="center">
<p style="color: white;font-family:georgia;font-size:2vw"> Fashion week is a very important aspect of the runway. It is a week-long (approx.) event  where designers, brands, or "houses" display their latest collections to a large audience of viewers and media. Haute couture used to be considered exclusive and somewhat secretive and is now broadcast to the public with the rise of social media. Looks are shown in advance, so a show in spring is looks meant for the fall. Fashion weeks are held in a lot of countries but the most popular are in the fashion capitals of Paris, Milan, New York City, and London.
